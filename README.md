# EYRC-2021-Functional-Weeder
In the theme “Functional Weeder” an arena that abstracts a farm, consisting of crop seeds to be planted and weeds to be removed is explored by multiple autonomous robots. These robots work collaboratively and communicate with each other to explore the unknown farm and determine where seeds should be sown and/or weeds should be removed. The robots are programmed using Elixir language with a dashboard logging the sequence of events and remaining tasks in real-time over the Internet.
The purpose of this application is to provide an efficient alternative for the two most labor-intensive tasks in the agriculture industry namely weeding and sowing. It also works as an aid for some other major issues like lack of labor, lack of knowledge about soil testing, low wages of workers, seed waste and water wastage to a great extent.
